            Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single press
            of the top button on the back of the right earbud. Then press and
            hold the power button for 3 seconds to put the headphones into
            pairing mode. Please note that if you connect the headphones for the
            first time, they will automatically turn on immediately in this
            pairing mode. Voice prompts will provide you with additional
            instructions. We recommend that you use the Bose Music app to
            complete the pairing process, however you can also use the Bluetooth
            settings on your device.
